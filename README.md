# Simulation for a small business network and systems using Vagrant and Chef

For a class in Network Security and Management.

The idea was to configure a small business network according to a set of requirements. Our solution is represented in the following diagram.

To simulate this network and be able to test the configurations as best we could, we used [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) and [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/). In [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), we can simulate the same network using the following setup.
